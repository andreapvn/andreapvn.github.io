Find a way to develop web apps using Haskell.

Ideally, should be able to develop an app using Haskell, which can then be
compiled into a web app, running HTML + CSS + JS.

Alternatively, should be able to run in a desktop environment having bindings
to webkit or similars.

Should Haskell be compiled to JS or should Haskell have a binding to JS, just
like it would porbably have bindings to HTML and CSS?

Check out GHCJS and reflex (and reflex.dom).
